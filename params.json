{"name":"HDR","tagline":"","body":"### Genesis Framework\r\nWordpress Frameworks extend core WordPress functionalities by exposing and then enhancing specific functionalities beyond their native purpose to create a specific type of theme usually for specific types of user. This type of development requires a parent and child theme relationship. We would develop the parent theme using the framework for functionality and create \"skin\" child themes with CSS styles for design/modification.\r\n\r\nPros | Cons\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nFramework + Starter Theme | Added cost $59.95\r\nThemes can be used multiple times for clients |  Framework needs to be updated\r\nMobile responsive |  Learning curve - takes time to learn\r\nMulti-language |  Dependent on parent/child theme relationship\r\nCustomizations won’t disappear (one-click software upgrade) | \r\nSpeeds up development |  \r\nMobile responsive |  \r\nCode library / extended functionalities |  \r\nSupport |  \r\nSEO |  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Wordpress Starter Theme (Barebones / Boilerplate)\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\nPros | Cons\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nFramework + Starter Theme | Added cost $59.95\r\nThemes can be used multiple times for clients |  Framework needs to be updated\r\nMobile responsive |  Learning curve - takes time to learn\r\nMulti-language |  Dependent on parent/child theme relationship\r\nCustomizations won’t disappear (one-click software upgrade) | \r\nSpeeds up development |  \r\nMobile responsive |  \r\nCode library / extended functionalities |  \r\nSupport |  \r\nSEO | \r\n\r\n### Redux (advanced theme options panel)\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\nPros | Cons\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nFramework + Starter Theme | Added cost $59.95\r\nThemes can be used multiple times for clients |  Framework needs to be updated\r\nMobile responsive |  Learning curve - takes time to learn\r\nMulti-language |  Dependent on parent/child theme relationship\r\nCustomizations won’t disappear (one-click software upgrade) | \r\nSpeeds up development |  \r\nMobile responsive |  \r\nCode library / extended functionalities |  \r\nSupport |  \r\nSEO | \r\n\r\n### Shopify\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
